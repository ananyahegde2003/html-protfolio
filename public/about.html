<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m a Computer Science Engineering student with a passion for AI/ML and full-stack development. My journey in tech began with a fascination for how machines can learn and adapt, which led me to explore artificial intelligence and machine learning. I love delving into algorithms and data patterns to create intelligent systems.

  In addition to AI, I’m equally enthusiastic about full-stack development. I enjoy building dynamic web applications and ensuring seamless user experiences, from the front end to the back end. I thrive on tackling challenges and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skills.
  
  I’m excited to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology!</p>
